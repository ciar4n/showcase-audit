  <p>International Christian Embassy Jerusalem

The International Christian Embassy Jerusalem (ICEJ) was founded in 1980 with the purpose of comforting and displaying solidarity with Israel and the Jewish people. Today, ICEJ stands at the forefront of an ever-growing movement of Christians around the world. They have in common that they share the love of Israel, as well as the understanding of the biblical significance of the contemporary restoration of Israel and the return of the Jews to their homeland.

From our headquarters in Jerusalem and through our national departments in over 80 countries, we seek to urge the Church to embrace its biblical responsibility towards Israel and the Jewish people. We also remind Israel of the wonderful promises God made to the land through His word, while trying to help the people of Israel in several ways.Joomla version: 3.9.5
