  <p>Many years ago, life was simple when the main source of meals was derived from farms. In today’s on-the-go lifestyles, many people rarely have the time on a daily basis to purchase, prepare and enjoy the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of fresh fruits and vegetables. That’s why people tend to eat processed, high fat and unbalanced meals. We’ve all seen the statistics of how Americans need to enhance their nutritional intake and increase the RDA of fruits and vegetables. Now is the time to make that change! Welcome to the world of Country Farms. A world of natural and organic whole food nutrition, the way it used to be.</p>
