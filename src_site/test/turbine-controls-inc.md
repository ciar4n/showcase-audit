  <p>Established in 1980, TCI is a world recognized leader with more than 35 years of experience servicing the global MRO market.  Our facilities located in Connecticut and Florida provide aftermarket support services for the overhaul and repair of components and accessories for commercial, military, industrial, engine and airframe applications.We created a parts directory and filled it with over 16,000 parts!  We used DJ Catalog2 to accomplish this major task.  Their previous site used an antiquated excel spreadsheet which took them forever to update.  Now they have a simple interface to edit or add any parts they like.</p>
