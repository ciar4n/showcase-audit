  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Darren Andrews was using a 3rd party service to advertise his 121 Maths Tuition service but was losing out on a large commission for each lesson. Through his marketing advisor, we helped design a Joomla! website that allows him to advertise his services, present free tutorial videos and offer past exam papers which are freely available for anybody to download.The website was built mobile-friendly, used Joomla 3.x, PHP7.3.x and hosted on a fast/secure UK based cloud server. 
We also use a great CDN service to push static resources to users, as there are lots of documents and files that are downloadable for users and logged in users.
An open-source SSL certificate from Lets Encrypt used, the entire site is accessed over https and HTTP2 is used too.</p>
