  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Radiology Affiliates Imaging is a team of medical diagnostic imaging professionals dedicated to providing superior, integrated management and radiology imaging support services to the medical practices that we serve for the purpose of providing optimal patient care. 

This site was designed to inform prospective patients about the procedures RAI offers as well as ancillary information such as locations where each procedure is performed, medical forms, etc...We initially developed this site on the T3 framework but decided to redesign and develop with Gantry 5 and SEBLOD for greater flexibility and control of content. SEBLOD allowed us to give their marketing department more control over custom content types such as medical procedures, medical forms, and locations.</p>
