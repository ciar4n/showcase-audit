  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>De Vlaam is a confectionery with stores in Gouda, Gouda and Boskoop. In 2015 they asked me to develop a new webshop on the basis of their corporate identityThe website is based on a template from Yootheme which i completely redesigned.
I used widgetkit, layerslider, Hikashop Business edition as webshop component and JDiDEAL a dutch payment plugin.
I developed a shipping-invoice plugin to work in backend and used a lot of custom fields and product options and the advanced datepicker to prevent delivery on sundays</p>
