  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>This website was created in 2010 in Ourense (Spain), by writer and editor Emilio José Iglesias Fernández, as Relatos Pulp Ediciones, with the purpose of spreading pulp literature in the Spanish language, being the first to do something similar. Since then we publish stories of classic authors, we make translations of those that have not yet been translated, and of course we also publish authors of our days, which we select through contests or selection of manuscripts. We also carry out research articles, critiques, and explore all forms of pulp art, posters, covers and merchandising for sale that help us maintain and continue with our activities.This website was built in Joomla 1.5 and since then we have updated it progressively until the current version. At the moment we incorporate a system of forums (Kunena), and comments in the articles of an external provider, since joomla does not have it in a native way (Komento). We also use an extension to manage the publications of our authors (Joomla Author List).</p>
