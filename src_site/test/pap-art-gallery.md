  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>This website present portraits of Paper Artists, technics and events of the paper world in three languages (french, english and italian). Plus a worldwide directory of Paper Artists.We try to give a nice interactive design with a lot of css effects refering to paper arts and its cultures. 
We try as well to implement an advanced search with custom filters. We use for this the Custom Properties component, which is very great to manage multi filter and to have a filtering module. 
For the directory, the website use the SobiPro component.
For language, we used Falang.</p>
