  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>In a time of fast-paced consumerism, we appreciate the consistency, the goodness and the quality. And we are not alone in that thought. More and more people are looking for products that are timeless and are so well crafted that they last far longer than just one season.
Thatâ€™s why we started The New Heritage.
This "Timelessness" Festival is a platform that provides an opportunity for all those who are looking for quality and authenticity to find the products and their manufacturers.
The New Heritage showcases two days of these manufactories and small businesses which are aware of traditional craftmanship, sustainability through quality and their own personal "heritage". Our exhibitors create products for eternity that eventually become genuine favourites and new heirlooms.

Just "New Heritage"Joomla
Joomlashine framework
Joomla tools: Easy Slider
Quix
Customized Portfolio (exhibitors List) by Joomlashine
Most difficult part: making site responsive on all devices:-(
DE + EN
Currently we will change the Editor PageBuilder 3 from Joomlashine.
My experience, if possible use extensions/framework/tools from one developer.
If you want to build a professional website, you should  think about of buying tools, not all free tools are that perfect. And for this perfect Joomla we need perfect tools and extensions.</p>
