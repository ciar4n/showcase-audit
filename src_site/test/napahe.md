  <p>NAPAHE serves presidential assistants (PAs) and other professionals supporting higher education leaders and strives to enhance our profession through programs, networking, and information resources that address the broad range of roles fulfilled by our members in service to presidential leadership and higher education.NAPAHE needed a membership site to promote resources, knowledge sharing and national events for their members. The site needed to be simple to navigate for all, including those with disabilities so WCAG 2.1 level AA standards were implemented.</p>
