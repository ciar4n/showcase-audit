  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The Vindhyan Ecology and Natural History Foundation (VENHF) is a registered non-profit organisation (2012) with its headquarter in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh, India working for protection and conservation of nature, natural resources and rights of nature dependent communities in the ecologically fragile landscape of Vindhya Range in India. Vindhya Bachao Abhiyan is the flagship campaign of the organization which works towards environmental equity and bringing ecological justice through research-based environmental litigation, strengthening grass-root environmental movements, supporting the institution of local governance and protecting the rights of nature dependent indigenous communities.

The website is the primary source of public dissemination of the research work, reports, updates on cases, maps, articles, news etc. ABeing a  non-profit NGO, we had very limited financial backup to hire a professional web developer as they were charging too much. We first used Wordpress, but soon realized the kind of content and performance we are looking, Wordpress alone cannot do it. A web developer recommended to try Joomla and helped us install it on our PC to try ourselves. We developed our first website using Joomla 3.2 and took us hardly a week to develop it with initial contents around mid-2013. We first used JSN framework but the availability of free and responsive templates was one of the issue we faced a lot. We then moved on to using Warp framework last year and using a free template Yoomaster 2. We have used several third-party extensions, scripts and embed codes to increase the functionality of the website in accordance with our need. The website is regularly updated with contents and new features.</p>
