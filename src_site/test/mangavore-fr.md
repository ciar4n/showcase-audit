  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Mangavore.fr is a French news website talking about manga and Japanese animation. Its main feature is an audio podcast where the host meet a professional from the French market to talk about the business. It also feature in-depth articles about anime, manga or specifics of the market.Mangavore.fr is running with Joomla since 1.5. The recent update includes transition to J3 and major overhaul of the structure of the site. The goal is to accent the focus on the podcast episodes and latest articles.

Joomla offers flexibility regarding the type of contents and podcasts are handled by Podcast Manager, a great extension. It also features EasyBlog 5 to allow the podcast journalists to post more personal articles (such as Japanese recipesâ€¦).

The use of J3, PM and EB5 allow the journalists not familiar with IT to easily publish rich content.

I also wanted something responsive and with good look, and I'm no designer. The Joomla environment features lots of great template designers and I chose to use one from JoomlArt. The features of the template, its ease to use and weight were important into the decision making too.</p>
