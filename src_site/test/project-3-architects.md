  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Project 3 Architects are long-time clients & friends of ours at ConCom Web design. 
They have grown from the 3 directors to a team of 15 and are responsible for some excellent projects around Altrincham, Manchester & Cheshire.

This new website is a showcase of there best, recent work and allows them to add/update new projects in the project section easily.Architects can be tricky clients, however, through a few iterations, we ended up creating a very simplistic looking website that works well in all devices and allows them to showcase some of their great work with hi-resolution images, which was the ultimate aim.

Built mobile-friendly, used Joomla 3.x, PHP7.3.x and hosted on a fast/secure UK based cloud server. We also used a great CDN service to push static resources to users, as some of the images need to be high resolution.</p>
