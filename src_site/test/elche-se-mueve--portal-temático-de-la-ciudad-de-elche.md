It also has a blog on technology, SEO, positioning, psychology, dessert recipes, Spanish orthography and much more.The site is developed in Joomla! 3.9 and its framework is Gantry 5.
The blog belongs to a third party extension, K2, and SEO to RSSeo Joomla!
The template is from InspireTheme, originally from travel and tourism, but has been modified in depth, changing the code and modules to my liking.
