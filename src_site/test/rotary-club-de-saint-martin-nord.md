  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The Rotary-Club de Saint-Martin Nord is part of Rotary International. The website helps to inform the island and Rotary about the actions and news from the Club. It's also a tool for its members thanks to the Member area and meeting calendar.The former website of the Rotary-Club de Saint-Martin Nord has been built years ago. It was just some PHP files, which makes it nearly impossible to update by club members. 
The Rotary-Club de Saint-Martin Nord asked IDIMweb to create a brand new website with a trendy design, a responsive display, a calendar for their meetings, a member area and multilingual feature, French and English, due to the geostrategic location of Saint-Martin.</p>
