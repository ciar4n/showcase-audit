  <p>A New Joomla Build to Facilitate Online Bookings.

Dollar/Thrifty Car Rental is regarded as the #1 Car Rental in St. Maarten/ St.Martin. With an extensive selection of vehicles, ranging from prestige, executive and extravagant, to city runaround, jeeps, sports, fun, economy and family models, this established business is committed to providing great service with secure and reliable rentals at value rates.

Furthermore, Dollar/Thrifty Car Rental has modern, state-of-the-art car rental facilities which were designed for a super-efficient and fast service. The business also includes a garage where it services its fleet of vehicles.

Previously, the company website was designed to serve as an online brochure without any ordering/booking tools and facilities. However, as businesses, individuals and travelers adopted web and mobile tools for their car rental and travel requirements, the company realised that it had to add these functions to its website in order not to miss out on webbased business.The Challenge
Dollar/Thrifty Car Rental wanted to capitalise on the use of online tools, including subscriptions for newsletters, a booking system for car rentals and a back-office operation integrated with its off-line business. It also wanted to refresh the website with a new design.

For a number of years, the company was using Joomla 1.5. They had no reason to change to another CMS system as they were happy with the performance, security and look and feel of the site. They were at a stage when the site was beginning to look tired and required a major upgrade to the Joomla core in order to bring it up-to-date. As they also wanted to introduce new functionalities, it has been decided to rebuild the site from scratch. The completely new Joomla website would also provide a better online experience for customers and ensure a continued secure environment for the planned car rental online booking system.
The Approach
Dollar/Thrifty Car Rental approached web agency IDIMweb to build the new website. After consulting with the client, IDIMweb created a new web design that included a seamless online booking system tailored for car rentals, multilingual capabilities, (initially with French and English, followed by Spanish) and a call-to-action for newsletter subscriptions as well as social media. The site would be fully responsive and optimized for multi-lingual SEO. All this would allow the business to evolve into a multi-channel seamless operation, and bring the online presence up-to-date, thus improving their brand visibility and operational security.

IDIMweb built a new website, still based on Joomla but using a new version - this meant they could adopt the latest web standards and include modern technologies. The site also required custom PHP development to tailor it for the company and location, and here IDIMweb worked in collaboration with Natural Selection Web Design. The new website was a step forward for Dollar/Thrifty Car Rental, allowing it to combine its online and offline rental operation within a consistent experience across multiple platforms.
