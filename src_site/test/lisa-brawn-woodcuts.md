Her work is in public collections such as The Alberta Foundation for the Arts, Calgary Civic Art Collection, and The University of Lethbridge collection, as well as in private collections across Canada, Europe, and the United States.

We used a combination of ZOO by Yoo Theme with a J2Store Extension for the e-commerce. The combination is both beautiful and functional.</p>
