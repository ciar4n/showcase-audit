  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Spanish Joomla! Community portal. Used as base site for JoomlaDays in Spain, but also for centralising the local community stuff.The site was born from the need of not having to build from scratch a new site everytime a JDay took place in Spain. These sites require a lot of community effort and even money (new hosting, domain), and their info usually got lost after the event. With a centralised site, we can save time and money for every new event, and save all the info generated by the events for future reference. We can even build several directories out of that info: events, speakers, talks, sponsors...</p>
