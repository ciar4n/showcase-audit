  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The website is for Blinser, a Chilean company that sells safety and security films for windows (office, home and car), with installation included. The purpose of the website is to publicize the company on the Internet and also be a tool to generate leads. The company invests in advertising campaigns on Google too.We received a client who had a previous bad experience. We show him some of our projects and finally, in common agreement with him, we decided to use Gavick's "Music State" template, which is oriented to a Rock magazine (RollingStone type), but which we have already used for other businesses, modifying the colors and the images, but conserving the functionality obtaining good results.
The user also requested that the contact form request other information, which is not possible with the Joomla native form, so we had to add the extension "Convert Forms".</p>
