  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>In today's "mobile first" context, where desktops and laptops are only secondary options for internet users, a traditional website of, say 5 years ago, just doesn't do the job anymore. 

Even if your business does not depend on servicing people online, it is a wise idea to go the extra mile and invest some time in a responsive and well structured website.
After all, you can make a first impression only once.


Have a look at Bureau Bronckart's website and feel why.Bureau Bronckart moved from a response WP website to a Joomla 3.x environment based on the Gantry 5 framework.  The goal was to restructure the web content with a professional look and feel, a great(er) user experience and a much better site security, using Security Check Pro.</p>
