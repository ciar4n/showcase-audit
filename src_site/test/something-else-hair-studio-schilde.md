  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Schilde (Belgium) has a brand new high fashion hair studio, called Something Else.  We were privileged to create it's young stylish house style, design a curly logo and implement a gorgeously looking responsive website in blue and pink colour tones.

Have a look at SomethingElse.Studio and let us know what you think of it.Something Else is a Joomla 3.x micro site on a T3 framework. 
The subtle built-in javascripts emphasize the digital artwork and therefore heavily influenced the choice to work with this framework.

It will soon be enriched with its a web shop for its own branded hair care solutions and casual dress wear.</p>
