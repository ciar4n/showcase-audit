  <p>Alter It is a Melbourne based clothing alteration and dry cleaning business that has many locations across the city.The Alter It website has several different functions. Firstly it's a place where customers can find their locations. To do this we used a maps component to list the locations (using Joomla Articles) and allow you to search by location, near you and also get directions using Google Maps.

They also have a small, but custom eCommerce function where new business customers can sign up. For this we used RSForm and integrated it to the customers bank so when a new customer signs up their credit card details are securely stored with the bank.

Lastly it's an information sources with a blog and tips/projects for the public.</p>
