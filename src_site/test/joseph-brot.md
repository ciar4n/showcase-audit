  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The site was built for the austrian bakery "Joseph Brot", which concentrates on traditional recipes using organic ingredients. The brand identity is very design driven and so is the website. We used the helix3-framework and their pagebuilder and heavily customized it to develop a website that ist not only stylish but also userfriendly and fast.The site was built using the Helix3-Framework and their sppagebuilder-component. The difficulties were to get the look and feel of the website exactly as the art director intended it and of course to make the design work for all devices!
We also had to have page speed in mind, which was especially important as the design contains large images and full screen slideshows.</p>
