  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>It is by seeing my mother create raffia baskets that I had the idea and the desire to exploit the fiber.
My first paintings were woven and made with wool large sizes, plants, dried flowers then gradually I refined my work, using the finest wools, which now allows me to detail much my subjects.</p>
