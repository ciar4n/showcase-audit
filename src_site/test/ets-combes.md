  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The website present a small familial firm specialised in industrial process and engines.
The website present at first the historical firm, then the services provided, and some examples of engines made by ETS Combes, and at least a contact page, this is a simple site but exactly as asked by ETS Combes.The website was built with last version of Joomla and is updated regularly.
Template is made to measure for the client and I used "Quix" to made easy pages to be manageables directly by users and owners of the website, so they can add photos, change texts for example.
Other important element is the backup for wich I used akeeba professionnal.</p>
