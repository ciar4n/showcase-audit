  <p>A memory for life

In the southern Årefjällen, on a southern slope down to fish-rich Ottsjön, located 550 m h in one of Sweden's oldest and most beautiful mountain villages dating back to the Viking Age, you will find us. The view of Anaris, Lunndörr and Trondfjällen is adorable beautiful. Ottsjö Fjällhotell is located 20 min from central Åre or 10 min from the downhill skiing in Trillevallen. With us, we want you to experience the mountains from within! Hiking, cycling, canoeing or kayaking, dog sledding, hiking or cross country skiing, riding Icelandic horse, rafting, snowmobiling or mountain trials along the marathon trail - all directly outside the door.Joomla version: 3.9.3
