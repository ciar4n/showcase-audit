  <p>This is the 3rd website we have designed for our friends at Brilliant Tours Ltd.
They are experts at private guided tours of the UK and offer bespoke tours anywhere in the UK for local and overseas visitors.

This specific site is to help gain more overseas business, showcasing some of the best areas in the UK.The website was built mobile-friendly, uses Joomla 3.x, PHP7.3.x and hosted on a fast/secure UK based cloud server. 
An open-source SSL certificate from Lets Encrypt used, the entire site is accessed over https and HTTP2 is used too.
We also use a great CDN service to push static resources to users, as some of the images are fairly large.
It also uses a 3rd party online booking system for the tourist trade called Rezdy</p>
