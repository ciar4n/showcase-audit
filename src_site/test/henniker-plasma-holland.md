  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>We originally designed the main website for Henniker Scientific [https://www.henniker-scientific.com] a year ago. 
A really interesting supplier of instruments, systems & technologies for vacuum science and plasma surface treatment.
They have grown internationally and wanted multilingual micro-sites created for their agents within countries around the world. So far these have included French, German, Romanian, Polish, Dutch and a site-specific to the USA. Within the next few weeks, we will also be creating a Chinese version.Created using Joomla 3.x.x, PHP7.x.x, using let's encrypt SSL and hosted on the clients own Siteground web hosting server.
We created the English version first and then added multilingual pages, modules and linked everything together fairly easily using the great multilingual features of Joomla!</p>
