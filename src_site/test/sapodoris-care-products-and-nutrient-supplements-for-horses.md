  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Sapodoris is an Onlineshop offering nutrient supplements and care products for horses. Additionally horse owners can get free advice on feeding issues.

Beside the products a lot of surrounding informations are offered.The Site is built with Joomla 3.x and using Virtuemart for the shop. The challenge while building this site was to lead the requests for free advice to an online form. The free advice proceeded by phone until we built the site, which was former hosted in a Jimdo solution.

The flood of phonecalls made it nearly impossible for the one-woman company to work on the orders and shipments. Using FoxContact we rebult the offer for free advice into an online service. The customers can now answer all questions at once, upload photos, documents etc..

The requirements of the GDPR and very limited options for a professional webshop lead to a change from Jimdo to Joomla!</p>
