  <p>The website is for travelers who want to discover eastern Poland in an exclusive way.
With Eastward Travel you are in experienced and safe hands to explore Poland. Journalist Marc Peirs guides you from A to Z. He is your travel guide, driver and even a bit of a butler. Your journey will be composed entirely according to your personal wishes.

You are also welcome at your home tour guide, in Willa Wisla, the wooden villa designed by the famous architect-artist Tadeusz Michalak in the picturesque artists' town of Kazimierz Dolny.The website uses the latest Joomla! version and a lot of extensions: Template and some other extensions from e.g. Joomlashack, Regular Labs and Joomlacalendar. Of course, no Joomla! Website can live securely without Akeeba back-up, Admin Tools, PWT ACL, the JCE editor and Watchful.

My main challenge was let the owner add articles himself and I used Form2Content for the first time, witch is an amazing piece of software that I will surely use more often.

I used also a lot of custom CSS, for the whole site or for some specific menu items or modules (e.g. page classes).</p>
