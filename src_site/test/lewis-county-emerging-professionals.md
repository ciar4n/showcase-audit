  <p>The site is for any professional in the Lewis County area. The Lewis County Emerging Professionals network was established to attract and retain professionals by enhancing the social, professional, and community outreach opportunities available to emerging professionals within Lewis County and to increase the opportunity for communication, shared knowledge and interaction between those individuals, uniting them in a common cause to promote community development and service.The Lewis County Emerging Professionals needed a site that would promote their mission, with the ability to post events and handle registrations, as well as handle yearly memberships online. We used Events Booking and OS Membership Pro from Joomdonation.</p>
