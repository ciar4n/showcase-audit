  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Dr. Hwang didn't need a website to attract new patients but as a service to referred and exisiting patients to get directions but more importantly access information on pre and post surgery care and instructions.Website built using BootStrap 3 and Embryo template. 

Because of the large number of instruction sheets the content was kind of flat for attractive display. 

Use of Joomla's tags was utilized as an alternative sort resource for clients when searching for their procedure information. Also utilized was Regular Labs Articles Anywhere so when the doctor or staff had to do any edits it would be consistently articles.</p>
