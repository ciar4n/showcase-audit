  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Home page for the annual Joomla web developer and marketing conference in Florida.  The site is managed by the Tampa Bay Joomla User Group.The JoomlaDay Florida site uses several extensions to manage the speakers and the sessions.  The speaker profiles are handled with Joomla Content and use the links feature to add the speaker's sessions.  The sessions are created using the Joomla Event Manager component.  JEM was the perfect solution due to the simplicity and features; we created overrides to the component views to style the event list.   The home page layout is a mix of Custom HTML modules and the Deluxe News Pro module.  The video was created with several clips from stock footage and displayed with an HTML5 media call directly in the template code.</p>
