  <p>Vignovin is a portal for winemakers presenting products, services and advices from industrials leaders. Offers, contents and contacts are regionalized and change according to the chosen wine region.This idea is to have a multiregional portal of specialized companies, presenting products, articles and contacts relative to the region and the section visited. This website was first based on joomla 1.5 and has to migrate to version 3.
The website use Hikashop to manage the products and catalogues parts and Falang to manage the different region, which are great components. It also use the DisplayNews module which is definitively the best module for joomla!</p>
