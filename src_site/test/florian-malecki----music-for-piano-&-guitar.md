  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>As a musician, I am performing as pianist on stage, in performances and on recordings. As a composer, I am writing a kind of „new classic“ music for piano and guitar. I also offer private piano lessons. 
The new webdesign for my personal musicians website should look clean, clear and cosy – and should be fast-and-easy to use for those, who want to buy products in the shop, e.g. concert tickets. The result is a modern website with a unusual layout concept, color-filterd images and individual article structur.
The website uses a vertical-split layout with 2 columns on horizontal formats starting at 1024px width and a fullscreen scrollable layout on smaller devices.Right from the beginning, we had the idea to put each single element of the article layout into an accordion panel: the article image, fulltext, gallery, media, extra-fields etc. were placed in the right columns accordion-module.
We used – as we mostly do at my agency dégagée – joomlarts' T3 framework with bootstrap3 to implement the template, K2 for the content and K2Store for the shop.
Because we used the vertical-split screen for all sections – Home, category-listings and single article view – we had to change a few layouts with html-overrides to get the desired HTML-elements on the left (e.g. K2 category image and description / K2 article image, title and introtext ...) and right part (e.g. for categorylist or content details) of the screen.
The shop, based on K2Store, offers sheet music, CDs and concert tickets.</p>
