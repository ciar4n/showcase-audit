  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>This site is for a home builder in Gainesville, Florida who specialized in Insulated Concrete Form (ICF) construction - the type that withstands hurricanes. They have been in business since 1983 and although they had a web presence, it was time for an update and for it to be mobile friendly. The purpose of the site is to educate consumers on what ICF is, the reason to choose ICF and to showcase the homes that they have built. In addition we have optimized the site for SEO/SEM.The original site was HTML and we converted it to Joomla for ease of editing and maintenance. We used a template by Joomla51 as our framework and added the client's branding. We also utilized IgniteGallery for the gallery of work and RSForm. The largest challenge was organizing and simplifying the information they wanted to include.</p>
