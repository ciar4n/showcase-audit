  <p>Arceus is a custom kitchen builder located in Melbourne, Australia.

The company did not previously have a website. They were looking for a solution which initially allowed for a product gallery, but would also allow for potential expansion at a later date.The site was developed in Joomla! 3.x with Gantry framework and RocketTheme Sirocco template. The product gallery is created using PhocaGallery. Frontpage hero image/slideshow is a RokSprocket module.

The business owners are self-confessed luddites so ACL was configured to only provide the very basic options the clients require for day-to-day use. Ongoing support and security to be provided by developer.</p>
