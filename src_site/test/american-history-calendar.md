  <p>Welcome to AmericanHistoryCalendar.com. This site is devoted to showing American history in a unique way: through a user-friendly calendar.  With this site you can browse and search birthdays of people and events in American history. You can also download an event or an entire calendar to your phone or computer using your favorite calendar app.This site utilizes the Joomla! application Zap Calendar for the calendar functionality and a custom Bootstrap enabled template. Google Maps integration shows events on a map with the option of showing nearby events. The site is integrated with Facebook, allowing automatic posting of upcoming events to Facebook. This site was originally created as a test bed for new features in Zap Calendar but has become a useful educational website on its own accord.</p>
