  <p>Ever since Kirker first launched a brochure in 1986, their aim has been to provide discerning travellers with a carefully selected range of hotels that provide excellent service and comfort, combined with private transfers, private tours and well researched itineraries.We have built Multiple Custom Components to manage:

Accommodation
Holidays / Itineraries
Images
Reviews
Holiday Availability Searches (using Elastic Search)

We have used a powerful indexing system to catalogue both the Accommodation listings, the Group Holidays and the Tailormade holidays which enables us to filter the search results by multiple criteria in an instant.</p>
