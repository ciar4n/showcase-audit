  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The Cuisine Trail of Lewis County is a group of restaurants and local food crafters brought together by the county to promote tourism and experiences in the area. They want to get the word out about the incredibly unique and tasty food spots there are in the region.The Cuisine Trail needed a simple, one-page site to show off the food galleries and display a map/trail for people to see. It serves as a directory for all of the locations and tells the visitor what it is all about. It is a small YooTheme Pro site that employs an interactive map component and a gallery feature. Everything is packed into one small web page in a clear and user-friendly manner.</p>
