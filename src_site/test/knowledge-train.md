  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>A combination of a branding refresh and moving from a bespoke php booking system to one managed within the CMS whilst keeping all Schema mark up and order processing requirements in place.We used a heavily customised version of J2store both in the front-end product view and back-end order management.  

Complex overrides were required to achieve this alongside keeping all Schema markup from the previous site in tact.

Speed was another essential requirement with the homepage loading in under 750k with only 1 local js and css file.</p>
