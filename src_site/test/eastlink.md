  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>EastLink is one of the major toll roads in Melbourne. The road opened back in 2008 and their website dated from that time. As part of a larger IT systems upgrade EastLink commissioned a new public facing website. The site is aimed at road users, the local community and businesses who wish to utilise road-side advertising.This was an interesting project to work on as it was a small part of a much larger IT infrastructure project. EastLink were also rolling out a new system that manages their tolling infrastructure. There are touch-points in the public website that integrate with the new tolling system and we had to work with the other developers to make sure that the integration was seamless. We were lucky to be in the position to drive the design direction for both sides of the project.</p>
