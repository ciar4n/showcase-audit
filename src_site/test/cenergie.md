  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Cenergie arose from an initiative of the University of Antwerp to develop new solutions for sustainable energy and energy management through energy audits in buildings and policy support. The company specializes in integrated energy management and developed into an authoritative specialist in innovative renewable energy concepts and techniques.The company website needed to have different ways for visitors to find the right information. And, at the same time, to have a clear structure and be accessible for professionals. Multilingual support was vital (we have 3 official languages in our country).</p>
