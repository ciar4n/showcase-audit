  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Everything about cruises with detailed reports on cruise ships and destinations, cruise diaries, travel recommendations and news on cruises, ships and shipping companies.We launched the website 2012 with joomla 2.5 and YAML. The most complex upgrade so far was to Joomla 3.xx and from YAML to Bootstrap. 
The website consists of more than 2600 pages, therefore every design change is complex and must be well planned.
We use the following Joomla extensions to accomplish this:
- JCE 
- Xmap (still working)
- Smart Slider
- Gallery from Balbooa
- weather_gk4
- Dxfontawesome</p>
