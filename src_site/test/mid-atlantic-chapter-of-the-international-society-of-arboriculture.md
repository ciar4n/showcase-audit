  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The Mid-Atlantic Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture (MAC-ISA) is a trade association for arborists, urban foresters, and others involved in the caring of trees. Their mission is "to promote a culture of safety while fostering education and research that supports the care and benefits of trees."MAC-ISA had an existing website but it had become a burden to update. We designed and developed a new modern website that will help MAC-ISA serve the community better. The website was built with a responsive design so it can scale to any device, but still retain it's visual appeal and effective content.

Their new website now offers full online event booking and registration for all their events. It handles event payment and easy management tools to keep track of attendees for each event.</p>
