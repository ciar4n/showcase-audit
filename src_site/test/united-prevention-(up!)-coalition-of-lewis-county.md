  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>United Prevention Coalition strives to inform and assist their community surrounding alcohol, tobacco, and substance abuse. The website serves as a crucial online resource to direct their community to, whether it is teenagers, parents, or other curious parties. It also hosts a plethora of articles, links, and emergency contact information to be accessed by anyone at any time.The site was built using a Yootheme Pro template and there was a heavy emphasis on accessibility (a11y). One of the key benchmarks to reach for this site was to adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 "AA" standards (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and it has been tested to show it does just that. This is important to us as developers and to the UP! Coalition as they would like to ensure their information is available for EVERYONE. There are badges in the footer of the site to show the level of investment and care put into this site's accessibility.</p>
