  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>CSPT (Community Safety Professionals Training) is a Charitable Company in the UK providing Community Safety BTEC to the community safety and antisocial behaviour sector.
They needed a new website to advertise the BTEC Courses they provide and allow new/exiting students to enrol and pay for their courses online. Also, they wanted a members/students area which would display specific documentation for the enrolled students, an area where students/tutors can chat online and an easier administrator area to manage students users.

We have created all of this and much more and know personally that the administrators using this site love using Joomla and the components we have used.The website was built mobile-friendly, uses Joomla 3.x, PHP7.3.x and hosted on a fast/secure UK based cloud server. 
We used 3rd party components from Joomdonation, EventBooking, Membership Pro, eDocMan as well as a few other we love to use - Akeeba, Regular Labe, etc
An open-source SSL certificate from Lets Encrypt used, the entire site is accessed over https and HTTP2 is used too.
We also use a great CDN service to push static resources & documentation for the logged in users.</p>
