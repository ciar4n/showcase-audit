  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Coffee shop on the go. The site is about the location and the menu of The Blend, so the  customers can read the menu and order by phone. Future plan to add online order pages when the owner will be ready with the custom application.The site was build with Joomla 3.x. The template is helix ultimate and I used sp page builder. Loved the process of creating the menu page with all the drawings and designs and configured them differently for all the devices (responsiveness).</p>
