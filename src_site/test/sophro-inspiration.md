  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Sophro inspiration is a website presenting art of sophrology with the help of a professional, to take back stress and calm. User wanted a simple site to present her professional activity, so we provided her a way to publish articles by herself directly on a blog, and to present all her services in a simple way.We used Quix to create pages content, most difficulty was to create shapes dividers, but Quix helped me to do that. Also we have used Quix to create user's menus too, so user can create articles and manage categories easily. For sitemap we have used a plugin called aimy sitemap, for backup sure we have the top rated extension akeeba backup.</p>
