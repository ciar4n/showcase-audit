  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>This site was built and donated to Crisis Nursery St. Louis.  This organization help families when they need it most.  Providing temporary child care free of charge for parents that simply have no other option.This site is utilizing many performance optimizations on top of using the Gantry framework for the layout and UI.

The backend had to be setup in such a manner that the site could be mostly managed by the staff at Crisis Nursery.  Meaning minimal 3rd party components and extra places to navigate in order to make edits and additions to the site.</p>
