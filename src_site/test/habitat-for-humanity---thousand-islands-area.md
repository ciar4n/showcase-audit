  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The Thousand Islands Area (New York) Habitat for Humanity relies heavily on community support. Therefore, it is crucial that they have a community-facing website to communicate all of their needs. They need to be able to broadcast upcoming events and volunteer opportunities, receive donations, and tell the world about who they are and what they do.The site uses a YooTheme Pro template and takes advantage of an event management plugin called Events Booking. This is ideal for having users reserve their place as a volunteer in any of the events that the Habitat for Humanity is planning. We also utilized videos to add to the dynamics of each of the main pages. They have been muted by default so as not to be annoying. The use of professional images and videos should help improve time spent on each page and overall user experience.</p>
