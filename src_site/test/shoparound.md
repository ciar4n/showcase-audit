  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>ShopAround.co.il is the first ever website in the Israeli market to fill a big information gap in today’s traveling world: the lack of proper, up to date information about shopping vacations abroad. 

Due to the nature and complexity of creating such a massive and ambitious project, which will eventually contain thousands upon thousands of pages, we needed a strong, feature-rich, reliable and future-proof CMS. Joomla! was selected as our first choice for this project, as it ticked all the above check-boxes (and beyond) and allowed us to run this project faster, more conveniently and securely.ShopAround.co.il was built using the latest version of Joomla. The main difficulty we encountered was how to create and manage more than 500 informational pages in the easiest way possible. Joomla made it possible by allowing us to structure the website almost entirely based on the built-in custom fields, for an easier editing experience.

In addition, ShopAround.co.il is fully responsive and mobile friendly, thanks to the UIkit and Warp 7 frameworks it’s based on.</p>
