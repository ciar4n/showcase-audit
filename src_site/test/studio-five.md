  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Portfolio website for Robert G Mears. Contains examples of my drawing, painting, photography and some essays, along with a link to an installation project website.Built with a modified version of the Protostar template. Makes use of the starlite pretty photo plugin, the SlideshowCK module, and eLEOPARD's Animate It! plugin (home page). And several extensions from Regular Labs are used. 
The site has a variety of page types from (mostly) full width to columnar. Page class was added to the  element to facilitate this. 
The top menu can be scrolled or kept fixed with a style-switcher javascript I picked up along the way, the implementation of which is done with Blackdale's Blank module.</p>
