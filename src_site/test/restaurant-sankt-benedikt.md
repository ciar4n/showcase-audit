  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>After my education, my current kitchen style developed especially during my work with Jean-Claude Bourgueil ** and Christian Bau ***.
 
After extensive renovation and modernization work I took over in early 2011 the restaurant of my parents with pleasure, where my mother, Gisela Kreus, already for many years had cooked with the award of a Michelin star.
 
The special demands on the quality of the ingredients and the conscious use of food are also the foundations of my understanding of contemporary, upscale kitchen.
 
Already in the opening year I got to the delight of my entire professional young team a Michelin star and has been able to defend him anew every year.</p>
