  <p>The Original Gene Watson Fan Site was initially launched on Friday 3 September 2004; the official launch took place on Friday 1 October 2004.

The Original Gene Watson Fan Site contains everything you need to know (well, almost everything!) about Gene Watson and his current happenings.

The Original Gene Watson Fan Site aims to show an appreciation for Gene Watson, his country music career and the undeniable contribution which he has made to the country music genre.

The Original Gene Watson Fan Site has been recognized by Gene Watson and his management team at Lytle Management in Nashville.The Original Gene Watson Fan Site has been re-launched on several occasions since its initial launch in 2004; a relaunch of the site took place on Wednesday 11 April 2012.

A further re-design of The Original Gene Watson Fan Site took place between December 2014 and September 2016; the re-launch took place on Thursday 8 September 2016.

A further re-design of The Original Gene Watson Fan Site took place between Friday 21 June 2019 and Tuesday 25 June 2019, when I purchased a template, 'Merveille'; the re-launch of the site took place on Tuesday 25 June 2019.

I used the core elements of the Joomla! platform to design The Original Gene Watson Fan Site, which I enjoyed working with.

One of the major difficulties I experienced was getting to grasp the fact that menus control which elements appear on a page, but once I got used to how things worked, everything became straight forward.</p>
