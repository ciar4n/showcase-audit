  <p>To advertise my photography services which is mainly aimed at newly engaged couples, so mainly wedding photography, but within the site map i have links to surf photography, portraiture etc.Happy with the look, though have changed direction of photography, i used to shoot street photography, then into landscapes and surf photography. Now i am focusing on wedding photography and i am struggling with getting the site found for SEO. But adding the 3rd party plugins has enabled me to sort out the  structured data. Think it is just settling in the results after many days of changes.
