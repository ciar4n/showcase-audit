  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The New Providence Library was looking for a new modern look, and a website that is easily updatable by the staff and the library director.Initially New Providence Library was built in html... they then moved to a very basic Joomla 2.5 site several years ago.  In 2018 we converted the site to a new template and upgraded Joomla to the 3.x series.

The style is very clean, and easy to follow through the menu structure, which was a requirement of the director of the library.

Tools used are:
1. Use YooTheme Pro for the template
2. Ignite Gallery for the slide show / images
3. DropFiles for an easy .pdf file management system
Drop files was an excellent choice to manage multiple files such as board meeting minutes.  The director can easily upload them and display them.
4. jevents to manage all events</p>
