  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>A bit up the mountain, over Ottsjön's western shore, at Hållfjällets fot, overlooking the Anaris mountains in the east via Rekhuvudet, Kösjön and Ånnsjön in the west, we have been since the 1940s. A luxury oasis with hot water, central heating, wood-fired sauna and mountain food but with economical access to electricity and patchy mobile coverage.

Come to us for warmth and rest, candles and crackling fire. With us, time stands still. We offer accommodation with full board in kurbits-measuring bunk beds. Come alone, in family, as a conference or in a group. In winter, we have day-open dining for passers-by. Warm yourself by the fireplace with a rich soup or a freshly baked bun.

To us you come with skis, snowshoes, scooters, dog sledges or other snowmobiles. From the railway station in Ottsjö it is 8 km. From the turnaround in Edsåsdalen it is 12 km.Joomla version: 3.9.3
