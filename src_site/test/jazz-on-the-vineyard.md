  <p>Founded in 2011, Student Achievement Through Opportunity (SATO) is a Hartford, Connecticut based organization dedicated to closing the opportunity gapand committed to addressing challenges of academic achievement for minority and low income students through programs providing both academic and cultural enrichment opportunities. 

SATO seeks to assist middle school students in broadening their sense of possibility, and provides support as they pursue access to higher education. At SATO, we believe student success involves creating opportunities that address the impediments  our young scholars face. By addressing the "achievement gap", SATO provides students with a unique opportunity to move beyond traditional approaches to education, learning and life. SATO exists in close collaboration with educators, schools, students and parents equally committed to increasing the development of talented young scholars who will realize their potential and be poised to assist and elevate their local communities.</p>
