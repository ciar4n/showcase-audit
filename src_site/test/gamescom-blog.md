  <p>The GC Blog was foundet in 2006 and is available completly in the german language. In some years we want to use the multi language part of joomla.

The GC Blog is a news and community site, which annually reports from the gamescom in cologne. The project is for all gamer who wants the latest News and Information from the fair trade.We started in 2006 with Wordpress. The website became bigger and bigger and we wanted realise other features like a community part, event calendar, differen Logins with ACL.

So we moved from wordpress to Joomla 3.x. We codes an import script that importet all articles from Wordpress in to K2 database. For the News Part we use the K2 extensions.

For the rest of content we use the joomla articles.</p>
