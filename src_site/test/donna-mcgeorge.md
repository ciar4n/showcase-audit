  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Donna McGeorge is a firecracker; a dynamic transformer of company culture.

Whether as a speaker, trainer, or facilitator, Donna responds to individual, team and company needs with directness, authenticity and overflowing enthusiasm.This is the 7th website we have designed and build by using Joomla! CMS for Donna McGeorge over the last 11 years.

The biggest issue we've faced over the years is keeping up with the fluid nature of Donna's business and ensuring the each new design is unique and portrays her business in the right way.

A new feature in this site is the ability to sell subscriptions to give clients access to online learning content.</p>
