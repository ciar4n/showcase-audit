To describe the physical therapy services that the Femina PT team provides in the greater Los Angeles areaThis site was designed as a new "women centric" site for Heather Jeffcoat's physical therapy services to complement her primary website Fusion Wellness & Physical Therapy (https://fusionwellnesspt.com) which caters to all genders.

Like Fusion Wellness, the Femina site is built on the Joomla platform. Heather and her staff blog regularly using the standard Joomla content component.
