  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>We built this site for a real estate company here in Florida to allow users to search properties as well as highlight their own properties. This was a site update from an old outdated html site where the MLS didn't work properly.We used iProperty extension from Thinkery, LLC to incorporate the MLS search functionality and then designed around that.</p>
