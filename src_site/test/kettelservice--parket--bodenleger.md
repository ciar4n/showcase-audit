  <p>The site is a simple introductory web site. The difficulty was due to the fact that I had to build the whole page in German and I did not speak German. For the design of the page, I just got a photo of a flyer.
There was a request for the logo and headline to appear, but only the contact details on the page should be scrolled. Also, they wanted a little wave that disappears behind the content scrolling.The framework is Joomla's latest version. The webpage template was made with CK template maker. View the reference pictures in the OS gallery.The pages were designed with a CK page builder. I solved the parallax solution with aikon easy parallax. Of course, it is responsive and safe.</p>
