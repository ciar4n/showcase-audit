  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The website was built for a Cranes company based in Western Australia. Our client required a simple website that would allow them to easily manage it. 

The website is built using the Warp 7 framework with Uikit. YOOthemeâ€™s Zoo controls all the pages, galleries and applications.

The website is easy to manage because we have integrated image resizing and created text boxes for each application our client can update.Warp 7 framework
