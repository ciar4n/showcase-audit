  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>This is a website of our online real estate agency selling and renting condos, houses or apartments in the Sukhumvit area of Bangkok, Thailand. Aimed at ex pats in Thailand wanting to live in the Sukhumvit area.Our first build was some years ago on Joomla 1.5 and the free JEA estate agency component. This was kept going until 2017 when we migrated to a new site built on Joomla 3.x and the OS Property component. The main issues we faced or still face is the very frequent updates of Joomla and other components / plugins taking up too much time to implement. An update does not go by without something breaking on the site.

We are now on the latest build of Joomla  - version 3.8.6</p>
