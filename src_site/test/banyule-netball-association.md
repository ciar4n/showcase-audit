  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Website for the Banyule & Districts Netball Assocation (BDNA) located in Melbourne, Victoria.

Netball is a primarily-female sport played in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and a variety of other countries. BDNA offer competitions for both junior and senior players, as well as mixed (male and female team) competitions.

The site provides information for potential new players and also existing players - fixtures, results, registration information, etc.The site was built in Joomla!3.x with Gantry framework and RocketTheme Audacity template.

Netball Australia utilises a database registration system called MyNetball, which needed to be incorporated into the site but does not offer direct database access. 

Apart from one paid competition administrator, all other site managers are volunteers so technical ability may vary widely - for this reason, the site needed to be very user-friendly.</p>
