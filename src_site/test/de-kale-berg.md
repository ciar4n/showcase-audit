  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Website for cyclists who want to climb the Mont Ventoux in France. The mountain, the roads, the challenges, the weather, events, challenges, where to stay, news, stories, photos, routes.
'De Kale Berg' means in English 'The Bald Mountain'. 
The site aims to inform Dutch speaking cyclists from the Netherlands and Belgium about cycling the Mont Ventoux, a mountain 'hors categorie' in Provence, France, well known from the Tour de France.
The site is very up-to-date. There's also a facebook page.Some twenty years ago I built a homepage in HTML about cycling the Mont Ventoux. Then I discovered Joomla! and I built a real site in Joomla 1.5. Later I upgraded to Joomla 2.5 and 3.x. I use a lot of extensions to show all the content. I use the standard template Beez.</p>
