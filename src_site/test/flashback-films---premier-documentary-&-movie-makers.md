  <p>Flashback Films is run by veteran of Indian movie industry, Mr. Desikan Ranganathan. 

Flashback films has produced no of ad films and general awareness documentary. The quality of content is top-notch.Joomla core component and free plug-ins were used to create this website. Template is custom made. Main challenge was how to show so many videos on one place as it slows down the loading of page. So instead of embedded images the images tied with links were used on all pages hence keeping the site loading time intact.</p>
