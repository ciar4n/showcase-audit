  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Website for an association that lists all the activities that can be done for prisoners in Belgian prisons. It goes from reading books, to sports and theater. Everything is classified either by type of activity, organisation or prison.On the previous site, already made with Joomla, a component already existed to list all these activities. However, it had to be rebuilt from scratch since an update of Joomla was going to make it obsolete. The list of activities has therefore been completely rebuilt.</p>
