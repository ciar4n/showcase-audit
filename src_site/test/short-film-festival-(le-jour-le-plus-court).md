  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>This website is about a Short Film Festival. 

So you have Sessions, Films and Venues which are all interrelated.
Given the fact that the Films are Short Films, the particularity is that each session must be related to multiple Films (up to 25).

Visitors can easily filter on the Films according to City and/or the Channel.This site was built using basically only Joomla core functionalities, making extensive use of Custom Fields which came along with Joomla 3.7 and make Joomla so powerful. 
There is a list of Films, a list of Venues and a list of Sessions, all being linked to each other. 
So no Content Construction Kit (CCK), only Joomla Core. 
In order to have a nice design and an ergonomic view on Films/Sessions/Venues, several Layout Overrides have been made.</p>
