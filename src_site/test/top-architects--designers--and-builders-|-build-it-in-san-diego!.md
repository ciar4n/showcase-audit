Showcasing the Best of San Diego

A curated sampling of San Diego's most innovative, imaginative, and well respected architects, designers, builders, suppliers, and skilled labor providers.This site was created as a portal for San Diego based companies in the building trades to showcase their talents and boost traffic to their own sites.

The primary component used is the excellent DJ Classifieds, which allows users to create an account and then post their own listings (ads) that link back to their company sites if they so wish.

The template is Naomi from Joomla51 and it also uses DJ Media Tools and DJ Image Slider to showcase images by the site's members.</p>
