  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Hungarian football site which collects amateur teams of Budapest and shows its datas, results, goals, events, news, etc. This site is for football fans. Amateurs in this sports usually get less attention in our country, due to this we decided to make a colorful site for this.The site was built in 2012. We started with version 1.5. Because it seemed to be a complex task to publish so many datas of the football teams and we have being looked for tool where we can write news just like in a blog feed, furthermore most of the things are automated and pre-programmed, there was no question that the solution is a CMS. We checked a few system and Joomla! looked the most flexible managing system.</p>
