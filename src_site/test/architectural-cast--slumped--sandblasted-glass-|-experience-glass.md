  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Experience Glass is a family run company based in Carlsbad, California, designing custom glass products including thick glass, slumped, ColorFuse™, sandblasted, and PermaCoat™ glass for architectural, flooring, lighting, walls, wall dividers, stairways, countertops, and more. We market our products under the trade name "Experience Glass", and our extensive list of satisfied clients includes custom home builders, architectural firms, and retail establishments, to name a few.Their previous site was clunky, ugly, and made with... WordPress! (uhg!)

This new site which has been up since 2017 was built with the excellent Joomla template "Hue" from JoomlaXTC, and features the company's slumped glass and sandblasted glass products.

The biggest issue we faced was creating attractive modules to show off all of the various colors, textures, and patterns available, and placing them in the proper places on the proper pages.

The site is fully SEO optimized and uses a number of free and commercial SEO, page speed, and security extensions.</p>
