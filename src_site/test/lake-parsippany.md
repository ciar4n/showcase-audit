  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Lake Parsippany is a private lake quietly nestled in the center of Parsippany-Troy Hills, in Morris County,NJ. This 168 acre lake and grounds is fully funded and maintained by membership fees and member volunteers. We receive no State, County or Township funding. Our Community welcomes everyone to join our association and enjoy a piece of the lake. 

The Lake Parsippany Property Owners Association members maintain and manage all operations of the lake throughout the year. The membership preserves this beautiful natural resource through its fees and through active volunteer participation in the community.As a not for profit organization, outsourcing website design and maintenance would be a heavy burden to the organization's budget. Choosing Joomla allowed the organization to create, design and maintain a website we can be proud of with very little cost.
Joomla allows us to keep members and the community updated with local events.
Community builder lets Coaches and Club Leaders update their specific pages and keep their members up to date.
JEvents also organizes events with a great looking calendar.
There are many other extensions used and we could not be happier with the choice we made.</p>
