  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>MK Surveys are a Land, Building & Utility Surveying Company based in the UK but also undertaking survey works world wide. The purpose of the site is to showcase our companies services and let our clients know what we can offer.Website was built in joomla 3 (and updated regularly to the latest version). 
Fully responsive for computer and phones. Template based on Protostar.
Our previous website was based on Joomla 1.5 and had not been upgraded by our website hosts at all, with only minor updates by myself to the content. We chose to take full control of the site when Joomla 3.x came out and created the full site from scratch as a modern site to work on all devices.</p>
