  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The Tree Hotel offers a unique hotel experience: tree rooms with contemporary design in the middle of unspoiled nature in the north of Sweden.There were no real issues using Joomla for this project as it the Tree Hotel does all the work and we can't really do the place justice online. 

Integrated with booking engine for bookings but it has to be visited to really be experienced.</p>
