  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>This new website for Solar Panel Options is used as a marketing tool to showcase the projects they have done and their technical skills and capacity.Overall this is a simple site built on Joomla 3, but to allow us to use some project specific in the Case Studies section we have used Custom Fields to add additional data to the case study articles.

These custom fields are also used in a newflash module to show the details on the home page, and also an override for the category blog layout.</p>
