  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>At Neocrisis, we focus on reviews and interviews that cover a wide range of topics and industries from video games all the way to comics. We also provide news and updates from gaming and other industries.I use a number of extensions on the site. The most visible one is Minitek Wall that shows on the front page a image grind. It is so simple to use. It shows the latest articles you have selected onto it. I assign what gets shown onto by assigning a custom tag, in my case i use "front page," to tell the extension to put a specific article into a grid. I think there are other ways to assign the articles such as where the article is located on the site; news, review or any other section.

I think the most coolest extension i have on my site is called GK Rating Plugin. It makes review scores simply look awesome. I mean, before this my review scores were shown as 9/10. Now it makes our reviews that more professional looking. The truth is i found this by accident and I sure am happy I did.</p>
