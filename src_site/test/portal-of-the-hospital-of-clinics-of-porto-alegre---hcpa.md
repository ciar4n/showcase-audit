  <p>Portal of the Hospital of Clinics of Porto Alegre - HCPA.
Public hospital, general and university hospital, attending about 60 specialties, with clientele formed, mainly, by SUS patients (SUS - Sistema Único de Saúde/ Health Unic System)Site made with Joomla 3.x, based on a site with Joomla 1.0.15. The entire content structure, layout and menus have been redone. Several free third-party components have been studied to meet the site's functionality requirements and maintain development at a low cost.

The system's native access control system was used to manage and organize publishers, so it was possible to organize publishers into groups of accesses that have permission to edit only on their respective pages or site components related to their area of activity.

The portal has several own development components, using the Joomla framework, providing several solutions to support the work of employees in their daily activities.</p>
