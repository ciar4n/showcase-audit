  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The ASL des Terres Basses is a homeowners' association of the island of St. Martin (FWI). Most part of the site is accesssible to teh association's members only.The ASL des Terres Basses (homeowners' association) had a website powered by another CSM. The management and maintenance costs were too hard/high according to their needs. They asked IDIMWeb to rebuild it with Joomla and ensure an easy management and a reasonable maintenance cost. The website is a simple one, it needed a public area, mostly for the news and contact and a member area. The member area constains private news, and documentation. An extension has been used to customize the registration fields and allows to get a table automatically created with the member details.
As an important part of members are living in the US, the website is both in French and American English</p>
