  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Originally created as the Australian exploration arm of a Canadian company, Chinova Resources was at the time the biggest exploration company in Australia. These extraordinary beginnings have given Chinova a growth platform from which to expand, based primarily on its significant holdings in the Mt Isa region of north western Queensland and its well-respected exploration capability.Chinova’s old website looked dated and out-of-touch, and because the Joomla software hadn’t been updated in some time their website was continually being hacked causing it to go offline.

A large, full-screen image slideshow was used on the homepage along with marketing messages that outline the projects and affiliations of the company. Icons and quick links direct users to the main pages of the site, providing an easy way of accessing the internal pages.

The Gemini template from Rockettheme was used as a base for this site, with Simple Image Gallery showcasing the various mining projects that are currently in progress.

The following have been implemented on the website:-
Joomla website development + custom design
Responsive design
Projects gallery
Full width slideshow
Individual sidebar menus
