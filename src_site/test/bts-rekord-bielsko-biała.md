  <p>This website if for Football club BTS Rekord.
Club has team in 3 division of polish league, women team in 1 division and plenty of kids teams. More over we have Futsal team that is the best in Poland and plays in UEFA Futsal Champions League.We use Joomla since 2010. the most important component wast the one that draws fixtures, tables etc. for many teams. Good enough was component called Joomleague but it's no longer developed. we had to decide to write our own component or to look for something else. We found Joomsport. It is not as huge component as joomleague but it is decent and we like it a lot.</p>
