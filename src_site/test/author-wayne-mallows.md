  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>I have been working with Wayne since 2012 managing his website but also integrating and promoting his many public appearances, social media presence. Whitechapel Road; A Vampyre Tale and Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary; Book II of the Vampyre Tales are both in print. Book III Unnatural Selection is published and available directly from Wayne only. He has started work on Book IV. It is a joy to partner with Wayne and look forward to seeing his success as an author.

I hope you will take a tour around his site and stop and read chapter 1 of all of his books for free. Wayne's Vampyre Tales I and II are available worldwide via Amazon and book III Unnatural Selection is published and available directly from Wayne. You'll be glad you did!
