  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>A website to showcase the home automation solutions and use of smart home design. It features a gallery of work and uses Youtube video for the main homepage background. The website benefits from having lots of great images of projects that are being showcased and also the simplicity of the template layout allows text and images to stand out.This website was developed from a redesign of the original website using the Logistix template as a basis. We provided a number of customisations and incorporated WidgetKit as a means of managing showcase items. The documentation for the template took some reading to recreate aspects of the demo layout  but we got there!</p>
