  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Bands For Hire is a live music agency based in the UK. The website showcases a wide range of live entertainment acts available to hire for parties, weddings, corporate events and more. We offer bands and musicians to cater for a variety of tastes, from pop, rock, soul and rock 'n' roll, to jazz, swing and world music.

Clients are able to search the website in order to find the most relevant bands in their area. Our aim is to offer a simple and straight forward user experience, allowing users to find their way around the site and enquire about bands quickly.The site uses the latest version of Joomla and is constantly kept up to date. We use K2 as the main component for our website; a simple to use platform allowing us to upload images, biography, set lists, galleries and MP3s for each of our bands. 

Other important (and quite frankly awesome) extensions include Jotcache, JCH Optimize and Akeeba Backup.

As there didn't appear to be an mp3 player that did everything we needed, we developed our own HTML5/jQuery mp3 player that was integrated into our K2 template, using the attachments feature of K2.

We also developed a jQuery 'Favourites List' which enables users to click 'Add to Favourites' on any K2 item and then continue to an enquiry form to enquire about all favourite bands in one go.</p>
