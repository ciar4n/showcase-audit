  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The managing director of E-Style won many prizes in the last decades. E-Style offers the best service offline (in their hair salon) and online (on their webshop). This website is used for showing blogs, making appointments and sell products. The goal is to give advice and gain trust.The E-Style website was build with Joomla! 1.5, migrated to 2.5 and later to 3.x. It shows a perfect integration of Joomla! and popular extensions like Acymailing, RSform, Ignite Gallery, Regular Labs features and VirtueMart. 
It was a challenge to create the right (amount of) (sub)categories for the webshop and the articles. We used a lot of modules to show additional content to several selected pages in order to improve the user experience.</p>
