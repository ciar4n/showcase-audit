  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Thrillz.co is The Ultimate Theme Park Review Site with theme park news. Plan a perfect vacation or trip to theme parks around the world and see people ratings and reviews on theme parks, rides, shows and dining locations for more information.

I camw up with the idea of an Ad-Free, wiki-style website that users can easily edit, add and review their favorite theme parks, rides, shows, dining areas with positive news stories written by volunteers.</p>
