  <p>Website of the podological practice Travemünde
The aim of the treatment is to maintain, improve and restore the normal function of skin and nails on the feet.

The team is especially trained in the care of problem feet of risk patients such as diabetics, rheumatics and patients with vascular diseases.The former websites were already built with JOOMLA since 2008. Over the years only technical updates were made, using the same look (but still becoming responsive).

Now it was time to use the whole screen and to present the practice in a new fresh style.</p>
