  <p>Kiddies Theme Parties is a catalogue based website showcasing the clients products and services to the public.Kiddies Theme Parties offer a vast range of party supplies and services and also need to update their website on a weekly basis. We therefore decided to design their website using Joomla 3 so that they can easily maintain their own content. We also provided training to their staff in order to keep the website up to date.

We built the entire website using the standard Joomla framework and the Simple Image Gallery plugin for their photo galleries.</p>
