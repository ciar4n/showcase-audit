  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The site is made for marathon enthusiasts and offers a bookingservice for marathon worldwide.

As it's a very specific business no real bookings are made - but inquiries. The detailed planning of the package is made personally and individual for each client.

So the website is the most valuable external service agent...Joomla is the base for this site. While corefunctions are only used for content and navigation, the catalogue is built with SobiPro. The searchfilter is the faceted search by Extly and the contactform is Foxcontact.</p>
