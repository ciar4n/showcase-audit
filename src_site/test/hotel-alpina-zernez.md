  <p>The Hotel Alpina Zernez has 7 beautiful rooms, furnished in Swiss pine. A particular attention to detail, in the typical Engadin style with that unforgettable fragrance of mountain wood. Our foods and desserts are those of the local tradition. The village of Zernez is located in a strategic position that allows you to easily reach St. Moritz, Davos, Chur, Livigno or the North Tyrol and South Tyrol .We started thinking about the whole project and then built an awesome website with Joomla!</p>
