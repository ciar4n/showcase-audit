  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>We create automatic gates from almost any type of material: wrought iron gates, timber gates, aluminium gates and more. With almost total flexibility and no standard designs or sizes, your choice of automatic gate is endless. See our Custom Made Gates or browse our Automatic Gates Gallery for inspiration.This is the 3rd site we have done for Automatic Gates, and it's a slimmed down version of their previous site with new branding. They decided their site needs to be more focused on their custom work and not selling accessories, so this new site focuses on the gallery, good imagery and easy forms for both enquiries and servicing.</p>
