  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Jeff needed a new site to showcase his construction business, so I helped him move from WordPress to Joomla.Because JKCD creates eye popping custom homes and commercial projects, we needed a site that could really show off all of the great photos of his work.

We chose the "Lifestyle" template from Joomla51.com and used DJ Media Tools for the galleries.

As always for my Joomla sites, I installed JCH Optimize for minifying and caching, JCE Editor, Easy Front End SEO, FlexiContact Plus, and Easy Calc Check Plus for securing the contact form.</p>
