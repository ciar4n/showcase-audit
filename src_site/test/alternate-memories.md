  <p>The subject is a pretty hot topic on the web right now - the Mandela Effect.

It's mobile first - although I made it scale up to desktop well enough so you can't tell.

The target audience is casual mobile users looking for light but thought-provoking reading. Perfect for 5-15 minute discontinuous reading sessions, i.e. on trains, waiting in line etc.A mobile first site with many custom modules. The goal for the "Full List" menu when viewing on mobile was to make it look like an app, which it does pretty well.</p>
