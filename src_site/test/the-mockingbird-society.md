  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The Mockingbird Society is an advocacy organization that thinks holistically, creatively, and passionately about meeting societyâ€™s obligations to children and youth who need out-of-home care. Our advocacy is rooted in the direct experience and voices of young people who have experienced foster care and youth homelessness.This site was built using Rocketheme's' Gantry 5 template Salient. This particular site was a lot of fun to build. I think this site excels at portraying fun and professional through its use of color. Joomla's flexibility made this development really easy.</p>
