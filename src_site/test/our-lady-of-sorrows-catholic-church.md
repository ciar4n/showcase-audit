  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>This site was rebuilt using Joomla! to replace an aging HTML site. We welcome all visitors from within and without the parish community.Built over the course of several years and with input from various stakeholders, the site is a realization of several goals including but not limited to: a responsive design, a format allowing multiple editors and content managers, a clean modern look and feel.

Special thanks go to Joel Mbugua and his team over at arrowthemes for his excellent support and patience in the face of the many questions that came his way throughout the lengthy process of building this site. We used his beautifully-crafted 'Mistral' template.</p>
