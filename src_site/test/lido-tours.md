  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Lido Tours is a travel agency and tour operator from Madeira Island, Portugal.

With over 20 years in the market, we specialise in minibus tours, 4x4 tours, levada (water channels) and mountain walks.The website was initially developed way back in the Joomla 1.0 days. Through the years it has been redesigned and pretty much rebuilt for Joomla 1.5 and then again for Joomla 3.x just a couple of years ago.

Our website makes heavy use of custom html modules and also uses a custom built module that fetches the date and availability for our next departing tours or excursions from our internal reservations database.

The hotels and accommodation section of the website is powered by JHotelReservation, a hotel reservation component.
Multilanguage functionality is handled by the Falang component and URL's are handled by sh404sef. Other components we use include Komento for our customer comments section, Chronoforms for contact forms, DJ Image slider for our header image rotators and Widgetkit for some image galleries and maps.</p>
