  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>This site was built for a local taxi company that specialises in airport transfers from/to the main English airports.

The goal was to provide the essential information on the home page & the content was curated with mobile considerations first.Built using Joomla! 3.6 and a Joostrap template.
Components used include Akeeba Backup & JCE, OSMap Free & is hosted on Siteground.

One challenge was to find ways to provide good calls to action from rather limited content.</p>
