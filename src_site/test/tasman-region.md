  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The Tasman Region website helps visitors to the Tasman and Forestier Peninsulas and the surrounding area in Tasmania, Australia.

The website includes a business directory and useful information to help visitors work out their own itineraries.The website is based on a customised version of the Audaciity Gantry 4 template and uses J-Business Directory to show business listings as well as attractions and activities.

A "Related Business" feature was hand coded to show businesses related to activities as this isn't part of the core extension yet.

Nextend Smart Slider 2 is used for the slideshow and includes social networking links and a GTranslate module to make it easy for non-english speakers to understand the website.

Event Gallery Extended is used to show off the gallery images.</p>
