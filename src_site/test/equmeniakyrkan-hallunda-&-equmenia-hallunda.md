  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The site is for those interested to visit or learn about the church Equmeniakyrkan Hallunda. The church is located in Stockholm suburb, Sweden. The calendar is one central part of the site. But it also includes magazine to download, blogs, media and various information.The site was build totally relying on free Joomla core and extensions. One specifitiy to solve was to keep it as one site and at the same time include three separate congregations; all are one church and much information is common, but it should also be easy to find the specific information for each congregation. This challange also includes that content is partly in one of two languages, or in both. Challenge to solve this in a pragmatic way with decent level of effort.</p>
