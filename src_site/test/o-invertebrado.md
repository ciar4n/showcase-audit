  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The Invrtebrado is an evolution of Rikáryo Mourão's Blog, the idea was very great, more people joined the project in the development of journalistic content and with almost 50 thousand accesses daily we decided to extend functions and accessibility among them an audio text converter for people with some type of vision limitation.

The Invertebrate - Policing to Politize!The Invertebrate Blog was born as Rikáryo Mourão's Blog along with Joomla! 1.0.x and has been migrating its contents 1.5, 2.5 and now 3.x (current version of Joomla!) Already planned the migration to version 4.x that comes around. We used the Joomlart T3 package and the JA_GOOD template and made a lot of template customizations, functions and audio reading for people with some kind of audit deficiency. Every day the Invertebrate Blog has changes and ideas of new functions always designed to keep the project competitive.

Currently: Joomla! 3.x - PHP 7.3 - Mysql 5</p>
