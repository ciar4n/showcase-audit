  <p>County of Ventura Resource Management Agency serves the one million residents of Ventura County. Located on the beautiful Pacific Ocean of Southern California, Ventura County is known for its outstanding livability and access to recreation: surfing, hiking, kayaking, biking, or just relaxing at the beach by the beautiful Pacific Ocean.
vcrma.org is the focal point for Environmental Health, Planning, Building and Safety, Code Compliance and Weights and Measures Divisions that help our customers obtain permits, ensure safe food and water, maintain livability and provide helpful pertinent information.vcrma.org was built using the Inspiretheme.com Oxygen template built on Gantry 5 framework. After looking at various CMS products: WordPress, Drupal, and Sitefinity, Joomla was chosen due to its robust features, ease of use, and available extensions and resources.
Inspiretheme.com offered tremendous support throughout the development of the website and using Gantry 5 with its available Atoms and Particles made building our site a pleasure.
Joomla is truly a fantastic CMS and our staff editors and contributors enjoy the ease of use in updating content. Our admins love the great tools provided and are extremely happy with the product.</p>
