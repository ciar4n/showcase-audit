The look & feel were designed around Shantom's identity and values.

Since SEO was addressed from the earliest stages of the project, Joomla made for an excellent choice of CMS with its core offering everything one needs to get started with on-page SEO right away.

The website is also bilingual, utilizing the Joomla core's functionality for supporting content in multiple languages.</p>
