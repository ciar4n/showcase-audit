  <p>Schleswig Wohnmobile is the biggest Camper Rental in northern Germany, providing more than 100 modern and well equipped campers.

The company offers rental and sale of new and used campers.

The site is built multilingual: German, Danish, EnglishEven though it's a rental business, online-rental is not requested, as the personal contact and advice are the most important factors for this business.

Anyhow for the UX we needed a tool to calculate the cost of a rental. To achieve this we combined some components:

-SobiPro for the catalogue
- Rentalot Plus for the Pricecalculation

Individual xsl-templates using the Rentalot Plus plugin solved the requirements.</p>
