  <p>Dutch wedding officiant Marita Terpstra needed a simple business website that shows who she is and what she can do for you. No-nonsense and easy to manage without any technical knowledge.We decided to go with SP Page Builder, since it's flexible and intu√Øtive, as well as easy to use and understandable for the end user. 
We only had Marita's logo and favorite colour (#00607c) to work with. The logo was somewhat of a challenge, since it's kind of big :), until we decided to place it in the photoheader below the menu. We created two small logos from the original one, for the favicon and to place in the logo position. Experimenting with colour pairings resulted in a beautiful yellow that contrasts nicely with Marita's favourite blue-ish colour. Marita's phone number on the top of the page is - of course - clickable so visitors using a mobile phone can call her directly.

If Marita wants to change the content, she can login frontend and make the necessary changes easily.

For us this site shows that Joomla is just as suitable for simple, easy to use "business card" websites as any other content management system. With, as a benefit, the possibility to add extra pages and/or functionalities.</p>
