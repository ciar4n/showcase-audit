  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>This website brings auto dealerships, their employees and supporters together on the most pressing issues facing the industry. Through education and grassroots efforts we will promote legislative policies that will strengthen the Connecticut auto dealerships.

The 270 Connecticut auto dealers are independent, family run businesses, not big global companies. They vote, pay taxes, live locally, and strongly support local charities. Our 14,000 employees, mechanics, sales staff and administrators, support a safe driving environment and support many other businesses that work alongside dealerships.Here at the MD Tech Team we follow the same process with every single client. We start by selecting the right layout that we believe will fit the project. We then install in our sandbox, customize to the needs of our client's brand, move to production, and then harden.</p>
