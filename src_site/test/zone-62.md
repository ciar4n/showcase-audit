  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>This is a personnel website for my project including free interesting content from across the Internet. Articles, Videos, Music, Images, Programs and a lot more.One difficulty was to find a good commenting extension. I wished that Joomla would had something like this integrated including a password Brute-force protection and a Local Captcha plugin.

Used Jooomla 3.9.1 Extension are:

Template Creator CK
Captcha - Mathematical
Limit Login Attempts
JUserPrune Standard
JLex Comment
ByeByeGenerator
MetaMod</p>
