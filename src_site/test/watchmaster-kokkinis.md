  <p>Having the experience of the goldsmith artist created together with Rosa Spanoudaki a place where the presence of the selected elegant jewelery and watches would bring them into daily contact with the people who for years now trust him in the piece of clock and jewelery which are more or less an investment.
For many years, a competitor in national and non-national car races has gained a distinct consistency with the time and times that he has always been trying to improve and evolve. Most of the time he managed to reach him and be distinguished by this great love in motor sports.Created with Joomla using Pagebuilder CK and using handmade template.</p>
