  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>This website is based on a simple idea: giving access to Google News by the use of the useful component of Feed RSS management available in Joomla!®.
Gugolando gives access to news of 7 countries: Italy, France, Germany, UK, Greece, USA and Argentina, classified in the same way of Google News.
A translator component makes possible reading the news in different languages, so that English people can easily read news from Greece.The project has started with one goal: be simply based on what Public Domain can give.
The News are free, thanks to Google.
The system (Joomla!®) is a free open source.
The background images are free, thanks to Unsplash.com.
The translator is a free component based on the Google Translator.
Nice, useful and free.</p>
