  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Yarra Valley Hockey Club is a community-based, volunteer-run Hockey club located in Melbourne, Australia. 

They previously had a different CMS site which was outdated and bloated, and the club required assistance with ongoing website maintenance and security. A strategic assessment determined a fairly complicated ACL was required, and additional functionality that did not exist in the old site, so Joomla was seen as the best choice for a new site.The site was developed in Joomla! 3.x with Gantry5 framework and RocketTheme Notio template. The events calendar is JEvents, and PhocaDownload is used for PDF policies and downloads. The majority of modules used are either Joomla core or Gantry5 particles.

ACL was configured and a Gantry5 frontend layout developed, as well as several core overrides, to only provide basic options the clients require for day-to-day use. Ongoing maintenance, support and security are provided by developer.</p>
