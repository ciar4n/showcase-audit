  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>ROC Nijmegen is a regional school voor professional education with 10.000 students and 950 employees at different locations in the Netherlands. The website needed something better: A great project for Perfect Web Team.With the project management, on time and within budget, this website was a challenge but with the use of srum methodology, sprints and user stories we build something that could be tested and discussed every few weeks.  Besides the project management we had specific goals for the website:
- Better SEO, supported by an SEO Benchmark
- Better usability, tested by a panel of students
Some results of this project:
- A new look & feel
- Elastic search for the the internal search
- Better mobile view
- Digital style guide
- Easy redaction of website pages (within a Joomla article)
- Checkout pagespeed & yellowlab results for this website</p>
