  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The Foster Care Association of Victoria was conceived and established by a small group of foster carers with the idea of offering support to strengthen foster care families. 
 
Through their passion and with the support of many in the sector, FCAV was incorporated in May 1992. Enhanced Government funding was secured for the organisation in 2004 with some additional philanthropic support.</p>
