  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>Tsundara Beach is a small private retreat with one rental beach house and one large villa, with private beach, large grounds, and trails through the adjoining jungle. It offers beautiful views of the ocean, wonderful sunsets, fabulous stargazing, excellent amenities, and unsurpassed privacy. Also features organic herb and vegetable gardens, and tropical fruit trees.Build with Joomla, Yootheme Pro, RSForm and GDPR Joomla extension. Digital Cameras..., Adobe Photoshop, BBEdit and Cyberduck. 
There are so many guesthouse websites for Ishigaki Island...mostly just in Japanese. To build something different I started by building the page multilingual, to get more customers on the website. And then making some beautiful panorama landscape shots to show the beautiful surroundings. A simple structure and design and no slideshows or other gadgets. It is my first website without a translation manager component. I just simply used the pretty cool multilingual capability of Joomla. It was fun to build the site this way.</p>
