  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>New official microsite of the Tourist Office of the island of St. Martin (FWI) informing visitors about available accommodation, restaurants, activities flights, further to hurricane Irma. 
Further to hurricane Irma in Sept 2017, the St. Martin Tourist Office needed a website to inform tourists about the 'revival' of the island, presenting them all accommodation, restaurants, activities available on the island.It's a multilingual website (en-US, fr-FR) with a search system, and newsletters, using Joomla latest version.
As it's a simple website, it mostly uses the core extensions. 
Third party extensions used are the usual ones: backup & protection, newsletter, sitemap extensions and a template.</p>
