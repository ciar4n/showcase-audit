  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The website for Royal Dorch Golf Club was created in 2015, as an upgrade from a PmWiki based site.  

Royal Dornoch is one of the oldest golf courses in the world, golf was first played in Dornoch in 1616.  Dornoch, in the North of Scotland, has a long and proud golfing tradition, and we've tried to convey that with the design and layout of the site.The site was build from a design by Melissa Grey in a collaboration with Cheryl Hopkins.

The template features a set of colour variations, chosen on page load, to make for a richer and more varied look and feel.  One most pages the header image is also chosen at random from a selection.

The design is responsive, based on Bootstrap 2.3.

The site also includes a small J2Store based online shop.</p>
