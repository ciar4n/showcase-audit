  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The official site for the Avalon Airport near Melbourne, Australia. Contains flight status information, integrations with flight, hotel and car hire booking providers. Corporate blog and information pages covering every aspect of airport operations.Client required a website that was updatable by themselves with ease, using AWS for hosting and with explainable and demonstrable security features. The site is build using standard Joomla 3.x files with no core modifications at all. JED-accessible extensions include JCE Editor plus pro add-ons Image Manager Extended and Captions, RegularLabs Advanced Module Manager, ReReplacer and Sourcerer, EasyBlog for corporate blog as well as Logman for change logging and Akeeba Backup & AdminTools for backup and security. The site's DNS is behind Cloudflare for security and DDoS protection. AWS LAMP stack is managed, updated and secured via ServerPilot. Hosting on AWS EC2 with Backups stored on two Amazon S3 locations. We had to build a few custom components to handle some forms and booking functions that had to work with the WEGO travel affiliate booking network. User experience was mobile-first and had to include all core use cases on the front page.</p>
