  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>The Alliance for Education from the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools is a countywide network committed to working toward the common goal of producing an educated and skilled workforce. 

The Alliance for Education works with partners from business, non-profit, community and faith-based organizations, and post-secondary education who are committed to supporting economic vitality and workforce development in San Bernardino County.CreativeSights worked with the Alliance for Education at San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools to redesign their website. It was important to have a easy to navigate site that boasted the quality and content of the their programs along with great video and photography.
The logo was produced via a student contest. We converted the logo and created icons for the site as scalable vector graphics (SVG) that are clean and helpful. Colors and fonts used on the site are inline with the parent San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools website (also a Joomla! site).
The site makes use of the uikit framework along with YooTheme's Widgetkit extension which allows the client team to easily change images used in the website headers. Interested visitors are directed to "Connect" via a form on the site facilitated by RSJoomla!'s RSFormPro. Custom javascript for additional control of the videos is delivered via modules with code RegularLabs Sourcerer extension and only on pages they are needed.</p>
