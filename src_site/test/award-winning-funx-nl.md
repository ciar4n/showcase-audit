  <p>The website of the radiostation Funx highly needed an upgrade after six years of delay. FunX is the public service Urban radiostation with a diversity of music styles like r&b, hiphop and dance.The challenge
The website of radiostation FunX was outdated and the lay-out needed an overhaul. The looks of the website needed better connection to the target audience and have more "radio" appeal. For an efficient workflow it was also necessary to connect to the central database applications Radiomanager and Radiobox. And maybe most important, seeing that over half of the visitors came from mobile devices, it was essential that the website would be responsive and show the best possible result for any screen.

The result
The complety renewed website of FunX was well received bij listeners and users. The website has become much more visual, has a better connection to the target audience and succeeded in getting more "radio" appearance. "Now I know what you look like" has been much heared.

Award winning project
The new website of FunX.nl has been rewarded at he international Joomla-conference "J and Beyond" with a "JOSCAR" for best n-corporate website.</p>
