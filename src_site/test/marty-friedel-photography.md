  <p>I'm Marty, and I love landscape photography.

It was only in 2015 that I started to spend more time with my camera (and behind the computer post-shoot), and communities on Facebook have really sparked inspiration, allowing me to learn, grow, and work on my own vision for what I shoot.

By day I sit behind a computer as a web developer, so being outside and visiting some beautiful locations is a great contrast, and has given me the courage to be more of an explorer in my local area - and there's still so much I have yet to see.</p>
